# Changelog

## 0.6.1 (2024-06-20)

[All new commits](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SWE-agent/compare/v0.6.0...v0.6.1)

This is (mostly) a patch release, in particular fixing several issues that had been introduced by the speed improvements of v0.6.0.
We also solve a bug where existing linter errors in a file left SWE-agent unable to edit (because of our lint-retry-loop).

## 0.5.0 (2024-05-28)

[All new commits](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SWE-agent/compare/v0.4.0...v0.5.0)

✨ The big news is our [brand new documentation](https://princeton-nlp.github.io/SWE-agent/) ✨

Secondly, @ollmer added a new flag `--cache_task_images` that will significantly speed up SWE-agent when running on the same environment/repository multiple times (no more waiting for cloning and installation!)

### Breaking changes

* We have reformatted our codebase. If you create a PR based on a previous commit, make sure you install our `pre-commit` hook to avoid merge-conflicts because of formatting. See [our docs](https://princeton-nlp.github.io/SWE-agent/dev/formatting_conflicts/) for more information.
